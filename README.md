# IMDBScraper
Simple console app that takes in a URL to a movie page on IMDB, scrapes the HTML on the page, and returns detailed information about the movie. Built with Node.js.

Start by running 'npm install' from your terminal to get the necessary packages.

Currently you'll need to open the server.js file using any IDE and adjust the url variable to any IMDB movie page, then save and run 'node server.js' from your terminal.

Once the app is running, go to http://localhost:8000 in any browser window and you should see a success message. You'll now have an output.json file in the project directory which contains your movie information.

Will soon add the ability to search your IMDB movie title directly from your browser window and output the output.json information into your browser as well.
